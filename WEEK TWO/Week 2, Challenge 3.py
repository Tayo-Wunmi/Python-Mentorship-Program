#Given: Two positive integers a<b<10000
#Return: The sum of all odd integers from a through b inclusively. (Solve using for loops and while loops

#SOLUTION


# 1. FOR LOOP

# 2. FOR LOOP



#Write a program that simulates rolling a die. When the program runs, it will randomly choose a number between 1 and 6 and print,
#then ask the user if they will like to roll again.
